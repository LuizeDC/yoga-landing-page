<h3>THE PURPOSE</h3> 
  <p class="primaryParagraph">
        Yoga is essentially a spiritual discipline based on an extremely subtle
        science, which focuses on bringing <em>harmony between mind and body</em>. It is
        an art and scince of healthy living. The word ‘Yoga’ is derived from the
        Sanskrit root ‘Yuj’, meaning ‘to join’ or ‘to yoke’ or ‘to unite’. As
        per Yogic scriptures the practice of Yoga leads to the union of
        individual consciousness with that of the Universal Consciousness,
        indicating a perfect harmony between the mind and body & Nature.
        One who experiences this oneness of existence is said to be in yoga, and is termed as a yogi, having attained to a state of freedom referred to as mukti, nirvana or moksha. Thus the aim of Yoga is Self-realization, to overcome all kinds of sufferings leading to 'the state of liberation' (Moksha) or ‘freedom’ (Kaivalya). Living with freedom in all walks of life, health and harmony shall be the main objectives of Yoga practice."Yoga” also refers to an inner science comprising of a variety of methods through which human beings can realize this union and achieve mastery over their destiny.

  <h4>THE BENEFITS</h4>
      <p class="secondaryParagraph">
        Yoga develops inner awareness. It focuses your attention on your body's
        abilities at the present moment. It helps develop breath and strength of
        mind and body. It's not about physical appearance. Mindfulness refers to
        focusing your attention on what you are experiencing in the present
        moment without judging yourself. Practicing yoga has been shown to
        increase mindfulness not just in class, but in other areas of a person's
        life. People who practice yoga and are mindful eaters are more in tune
        with their bodies. They may be more sensitive to hunger cues and
        feelings of fullness. Yoga is known for its ability to soothe tension
        and anxiety in the mind and body. But it can also have an impact on a
        person's exercise capacity. Also, Several small studies have found yoga
        to have a positive effect on cardiovascular risk factors: It helped
        lower blood pressure in people who have hypertension. It's likely that
        the yoga restores "baroreceptor sensitivity." This helps the body senses
        imbalances in blood pressure and maintain balance. <a href="https://www.spiritualityhealth.com/blogs/conscious-living/2017/07/19/understanding-the-true-purpose-of-yoga" target="_blank" class="read-more">Read more</a>
